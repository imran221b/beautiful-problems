Beautiful Problems Guidelines
------------------------------
Beautiful Problems is a web application for rating competitive programming problems across different platforms.
There are many platforms out there which have algorithmic problems for problem solvers to solve and practice. 
But not all problems are of equal quality. 
With the help of this web application, programmers can rate problems from different platforms 
on the basis of the problem's beauty, quality, educational value etc. 
Users will be able to see the ranking of the problems from the Ranking page. 
This will help them choose and solve problems which has higher rating (and thus hopefully, of higher quality).
